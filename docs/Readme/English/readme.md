**About DyberPet**: DyberPet is a desktop pet framework based on PyQt5. The project is committed to providing developers with the underlying function library for creating desktop pets. The project is currently in a very early stage, and we welcome everyone to join and build the framework together.

**About this Project**: The original intention of this project is to meet the needs of using DyberPet on mobile devices. [DyberPet](https://github.com/ChaozhongLiu/DyberPet) was reconstructed using Qt Widget to facilitate the compilation of the mobile device version.
